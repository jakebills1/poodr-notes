# Inheritance
- Ruby's classical (meaning based on classes and not modules) inheritance is essentially automatic delegation. If a subclass cannot respond to a message, it passes it along to it's superclass
- Inheritance in this case does not follow the biological definition. While animals inherit from their parents, ruby objects inherit from 1 other object, aka single inheritance
- subclasses are specializations of their superclasses, which are generalizations
